Basic Statistics Intermediate File
==================================

This file is created by the script :file:`misc/pairsStats.go` while reading
the :doc:`values files <values>`. It is a tabulated-separated values
file, *not* gzipped. The header row contains the column names. The other rows
contains the basic statistics computed for each datasets (which are the script
arguments). The last row contains the mean of all datasets.
