Welcome to PhyloHiC's documentation!
====================================

PhyloHiC is a set of scripts that allows the computation of distances between
genomes based on *shared genomic regions* and *genomic contact data*.
Currently, we use orthologous genes as shared regions and Hi-C data as contacts
information. Thus, you must already have these data.

This documentation is divided in three sections:

.. toctree::
   :numbered:
